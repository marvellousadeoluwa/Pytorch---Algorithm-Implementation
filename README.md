# Pytorch---Algorithm-Implementation
Implementation of Machine Learning algorithms (Linear/Logistic Regression, etc. ) using pytorch instead of numpy and other inbuilt functions

# Project Overview
In this project, common Machine Learning algorithms are implemented using only numpy and pytorch.

Project Steps
- Training
-- Forward pass
-- Backward pass
